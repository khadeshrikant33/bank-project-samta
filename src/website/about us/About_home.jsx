                                    <p className='text-justify fw-bold'>With a view to meet the financial needs of the small traders in Kopargaon town, Samata was established on 11 May 1986 in a premises of 10 by 15 feet on Shivaji Road with a share capital of Rs 1 lakh, deposits of Rs 3 lakh and 700 members to bring equality among the small traders of the taluka Civic Cooperative Credit Institution was established.

                                    <p  className='text-justify fw-bold'  >In Maharashtra, the cooperative movement of credit institutions was started in 1986. The time when the credit union movement flourished and the establishment of Samata Credit Union was a coincidence. Samata's economic development graph kept increasing every year. But in this economic progress, the institution also faced many crises. Mainly four crises have to be mentioned in 2006 when the deposits of Samata Credit Union were 57 crore rupees due to adverse news in local newspaper on December 6, 2006that the deposits of Samata began to decrease. But the Chairman of Samata Credit Union Kaka Koyate and the Board of Directors did not waver. Deposits of members were returned to members. Recovering from this crisis, the institution's deposits started to increase again in 2007. Then in 2009 Samata had to face natural crisis. The main office of the organization was flooded with water up to 20 feet due to the flood. Then the opponents started spreading propaganda but the trust given by Samata to the depositors did not shock the deposits. On the second day after the flood receded, the office was opened in the hall on the second floor of the grand building of Samata. After this, equity deposits started to increase again.</p>
                                    <p  className='text-justify fw-bold' >Even in March 2020, the corona epidemic was hoveringnot only over India but all over the whole world. So, there was complete lockdown in Maharashtra for 4 months. During this lockdown, job creation, businesses were closed, so depositors started withdrawing deposits for daily expenses, while borrowers did not have money to pay their loans. Even in this situation equity recovered and equity deposits increased substantially in financial year 2019-20. Even today this growth is mounting continuously. During this corona epidemic, Samata also did the work of providing relief to the customers and members of Samata.

                                        In today's modern era, Samata has made economic progress and through modern technology, Samata has reached the homes of every customer and member of the organization.
